# hello-world

Along the road to Gundagai
There's a track winding back
To an old-fashioned shack
Along the road to Gundagai.
Where the blue gums are growing
And the Murrumbidgee's flowing
Beneath the sunny sky,
Where my daddy and mother are waiting for me
And the pals of my childhood once more I will see.
Then no more will I roam when I'm heading right for home
Along the road to Gundagai.
- Jack O'Hagan
